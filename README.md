# Ants-SDE-Motility-Potential

### This code is associated with the paper from Modlmeier et al., "Ant colonies maintain social homeostasis in the face of decreased density". eLife, 2019. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38473

Data and code to replicate the analyses from Modlmeier et al.  This fits an SDE model to ant movement, resulting in estimates of motility and potential surfaces
